# Vue3-Express-Mysql-Tailwind-config
Template for using Vue js with an express backend for mySql and added a tailwind config

The express backend currently needs a seperate instance to the vue, will eventually figure out how to get it all entwined on one instance.
For now this will show you how to set up a basic express backend connected to a mysql database, and a loose example on how to interact within vue.

Vue has tailwindcss configured aswell, although not currently used in this repo, past the set-up. Set up for dev environments for now, so may need further tweaking for production.

Feel free to pull/clone and use, If it helps then happy days.
